## TODO

### Upstream PRs
- [x] G3 / PR #5098: merged 2026-06-28.
- [ ] B1: issue #5186 open (2026-07-04). Maintainer (AkihiroSuda) feedback 2026-07-06:
      feature concept accepted for macOS 15/26 ("feel free to submit a PR"); can't
      test/review the macOS 27 native-provisioning path until macOS 27 GA (out of scope
      for this feature). One required change before submitting: move the config from
      `vmOpts.vz.suppressFirstLoginSetup` to `osOpts.darwin.suppressFirstLoginSetup`,
      mirroring the existing `WindowsOpts`/`osOpts` pattern (`lima_yaml.go` L350-354).
      Done: new `DarwinOpts` type added, `VZOpts.SuppressFirstLoginSetup` removed, all
      call sites (`pkg/cidata/cidata.go`, docs) repointed. Commit `477f30c5`, pushed to
      `trodemaster/upstream-pr/b1-fakecloudinit`. Verified via `go build ./...`,
      `go vet ./...`, `go test ./pkg/limatype/... ./pkg/limayaml/... ./pkg/cidata/...`,
      and `golangci-lint run` (0 issues) — all clean, no local VM rebuild needed.
      Next: open the upstream PR (sign off DCO, reference #5186 in the PR body, state
      tested guest versions: macOS 15, macOS 26) — this is what actually triggers CI
      (`test.yml` only runs on push to master/release or on `pull_request`, not on a
      plain fork branch push). Holding off on opening the PR for now per 2026-07-06
      decision.
- [ ] B2: submit after B1 merges.
      PR description must cover: TCC schema v30 + tccd forward-migration rationale,
      presets shipped (sshd-full-disk-access, lima-guestagent-full-disk-access, terminal-accessibility),
      per-user TCC deferred (tccd revokes per-user grants on first login — by design),
      tested on macOS 15 + 26.

### macOS 27 workarounds (M1 + B3)
- [ ] Revisit M1 (fakecloudinit) and B3 (DFU) when macOS 27 is released:
      - M1 may be partially upstreamable if ISRootMigrator behavior is documented
      - B3 may be upstreamable or resolved by Apple fixing VZMacOSInstaller
- [ ] Test TCC patching against a macOS 27-beta guest (template exists in lima_mac, untested).
- Related flakiness observed 2026-07-05 (not in the M1 patch itself — in `lima_mac`'s
  `configure.sh`, which runs after Lima's own fakecloudinit as a provisioning script):
  on a macOS 27 beta guest, Setup Assistant hung at the first-boot progress screen
  (`Setup Assistant -MiniBuddyYes`, near-zero CPU) and a `defaults write NSGlobalDomain`
  call in `configure_screensaver` blocked indefinitely on the same cfprefsd round-trip,
  stalling Lima's "boot scripts must have finished" gate for the whole build. Not seen on
  macOS 26 or 15. Fixed defensively in `lima_mac` (commit `bcd1434`) by wrapping
  `configure_setup_assistant`/`configure_screensaver` with a 60s timeout — see
  `lima_mac/CLAUDE.md`'s caveats list. Same failure class (cfprefsd/Setup Assistant
  flakiness on macOS 27 beta) as what M1's guest-side Setup Assistant plist writes in
  `fakecloudinit_darwin.go` work around; worth keeping in mind if `ISRootMigrator`
  behavior is investigated for the M1 upstreamability question above.

### Verification
- [ ] Rebuild a VM using the new patch set to confirm behavior: B1+B2+M1 patching.

### CI maintenance
- [ ] Verify golangci/golangci-lint-action works under Node 24 (GitHub forced it 2026-06-16).

### Deferred / not planned
- Per-user TCC database pre-seeding: removed from B2 — proven non-functional
  (tccd validates and removes unrecognized per-user grants on first login).
  Revisit only if tccd behavior changes in a future macOS.
- AppleEvents presets (`terminal-apple-events`, `sshd-apple-events-finder`):
  removed from B2 — system DB entries for AppleEvents require special handling
  and the use cases are covered by custom entries in lima.yaml.

## Workflow reminders
- Regenerate patches from git commit ranges, never hand-edit
  (see lima-mac skill → "MacPorts Patch Fix Workflow").
- Bump the matching `*_rev` in the Portfile on every patch regeneration.
- `gofmt -w` all changed files before regenerating any patch.
- Never modify upstream CI config (.golangci.yml etc.) in a PR.
